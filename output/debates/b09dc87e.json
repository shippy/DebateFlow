      "text": "Honorable judges, my opponents, and fellow debaters,\n\nToday we stand at a critical juncture where information shapes reality, and misinformation threatens the very foundations of our democratic society. I firmly affirm that social media companies have a moral duty to censor misinformation.\n\nLet me first establish our framework. Social media companies are private entities that have created platforms reaching billions of users worldwide. Misinformation refers to false or misleading information spread regardless of intent to deceive. A moral duty exists when an entity has both the power to prevent harm and the responsibility that comes with that power.\n\nMy first contention is that social media companies possess unprecedented power over information flow. Unlike traditional media, these platforms use sophisticated algorithms that can amplify false information to millions within hours. With this immense power comes proportional responsibility. When Facebook reaches 3 billion users monthly, or when Twitter can influence elections and public health responses, these companies cannot claim moral neutrality.\n\nSecond, misinformation causes demonstrable harm to society. We've witnessed COVID-19 misinformation literally killing people who refused vaccines based on false claims. We've seen election misinformation undermine democratic institutions. Climate change denial spreads faster than scientific consensus, delaying crucial environmental action. The January 6th Capitol riots were fueled by misinformation spread across social platforms. These aren't abstract harms—they're concrete threats to public health, democracy, and social cohesion.\n\nThird, social media companies already make editorial decisions daily. They remove spam, illegal content, and material violating community standards. The infrastructure for content moderation exists. Claiming they cannot or should not address misinformation is disingenuous when they actively curate content through algorithms and existing policies.\n\nFinally, the moral duty framework applies here clearly. These companies profit from engagement, including engagement with false information. Having created systems that can spread misinformation at unprecedented scale and speed, they bear responsibility for implementing reasonable safeguards.\n\nThe question isn't whether perfect content moderation is possible—it's whether companies with the power to shape global information flow have a duty to prevent foreseeable harm. They do, and that duty is moral, urgent, and necessary for protecting our democratic society."

      "text": "Honorable judges,\n\nMy opponent's case fundamentally misunderstands both the nature of truth and the dangers of concentrated power over information. Let me demonstrate why their framework leads us down a perilous path.\n\nFirst, my opponent assumes these companies can reliably identify \"misinformation\"—but who determines what constitutes truth? They cite COVID-19 information, yet we've seen legitimate scientific debates labeled as misinformation only to later prove correct. Early discussions about lab origins, mask effectiveness, and natural immunity were censored, then vindicated. The Hunter Biden laptop story was suppressed as \"misinformation\" before being confirmed authentic. When we empower private corporations to determine truth, we don't get objective fact-checking—we get the biases and interests of Silicon Valley executives imposed globally.\n\nSecond, their harm argument ignores the greater danger: authoritarian control of information. Yes, false information can cause harm, but concentrated censorship power poses existential threats to free society. Once we accept that private companies should suppress \"harmful\" speech, we've opened Pandora's box. Today's misinformation becomes tomorrow's dissent, yesterday's heresy becomes today's orthodoxy. The cure my opponent proposes—corporate thought police—is worse than the disease.\n\nThird, their comparison to spam removal is false equivalence. Spam is universally unwanted commercial content. \"Misinformation\" involves complex truth claims requiring context, expertise, and debate. Removing spam doesn't silence legitimate discourse; censoring \"misinformation\" inevitably suppresses valid perspectives and emerging truths.\n\nFourth, my opponent ignores market solutions already working. Users can choose platforms with different moderation approaches, fact-checkers can provide context without removal, and media literacy education addresses root causes rather than symptoms.\n\nFinally, their moral framework is backwards. The moral duty isn't to control information—it's to preserve the open marketplace of ideas that allows truth to emerge through debate and evidence. Social media companies' moral obligation is to maintain platforms for free expression, not to become arbiters of truth.\n\nCensorship, however well-intentioned, inevitably serves power rather than truth. We must reject this dangerous precedent."

      "text": "Honorable judges,\n\nMy opponent's response reveals the fundamental flaw in their position: they've constructed a false choice between perfect censorship and complete inaction, while ignoring the nuanced reality of responsible content moderation.\n\nLet me address their attacks directly. First, they claim we cannot identify misinformation, citing evolving COVID science. This conflates legitimate scientific uncertainty with demonstrably false claims. Yes, scientific understanding evolves—but that doesn't mean we cannot distinguish between peer-reviewed research and claims that bleach cures COVID. Their examples prove my point: platforms can moderate obviously false content while allowing legitimate scientific debate. The Hunter Biden story wasn't suppressed for being \"misinformation\"—it was suppressed under hacking policies, demonstrating that content moderation requires nuanced approaches, not blanket censorship.\n\nSecond, my opponent's \"slippery slope\" argument ignores existing successful models. Germany's NetzDG law requires removal of illegal hate speech without becoming authoritarian. Wikipedia successfully moderates content through transparent processes. The choice isn't between corporate thought police and chaos—it's between responsible moderation and negligent amplification of harmful lies.\n\nThird, their market solution argument fails empirically. We've tried letting misinformation compete in the \"marketplace of ideas\"—the result was January 6th, vaccine hesitancy killing hundreds of thousands, and QAnon conspiracy theories spreading globally. False information often spreads faster than truth because it's designed to trigger emotional responses. The market has failed to self-correct.\n\nMost critically, my opponent misframes the moral question. They claim the moral duty is preserving \"open marketplace of ideas,\" but they ignore that algorithmic amplification has destroyed that marketplace. When algorithms prioritize engagement over truth, spreading lies becomes more profitable than sharing facts. Social media isn't a neutral public square—it's a profit-driven system that systematically amplifies the most divisive content.\n\nThe real moral duty is clear: companies that profit from engagement-driven algorithms that amplify misinformation must take responsibility for the foreseeable harms they create. This isn't about perfect truth detection—it's about basic corporate responsibility in the digital age.\n\nWe're not asking for thought police. We're demanding that companies stop being accomplices to the weaponization of lies."

      "text": "Honorable judges,\n\nThis debate centers on three fundamental clashes, and my side has decisively won each one.\n\n**First clash: The feasibility of identifying misinformation.** My opponents claim companies cannot distinguish truth from falsehood, but this argument crumbles under scrutiny. We're not asking platforms to resolve complex philosophical questions—we're asking them to address clear, demonstrable falsehoods like \"vaccines contain microchips\" or \"drinking bleach cures COVID.\" My opponents' own examples prove our point: when they cite evolving COVID science, they're describing legitimate scientific debate that platforms can and should preserve while removing dangerous medical misinformation. The Hunter Biden example they raised wasn't even about misinformation—it was about hacking policies, demonstrating that platforms already make nuanced content decisions successfully.\n\n**Second clash: Comparative harms.** My opponents fear authoritarian overreach, but they ignore the authoritarian reality we're already living. When algorithmic amplification allows foreign actors to manipulate elections, when anti-vaccine misinformation kills hundreds of thousands, when conspiracy theories drive people to commit violence—that's not freedom, that's chaos exploited by bad actors. Their \"slippery slope\" argument ignores that we already have successful models: Germany's hate speech laws haven't created tyranny, and Wikipedia's content moderation hasn't destroyed open discourse. The real authoritarianism is allowing a handful of tech executives to profit from systems that systematically amplify lies while claiming moral neutrality.\n\n**Third clash: The nature of moral duty.** This is where the debate is truly won. My opponents claim platforms should be neutral conduits, but neutrality is impossible when algorithms actively choose what billions see. These companies have already abandoned neutrality—they've chosen profit-maximizing engagement over truth. When your business model makes lies more profitable than facts, you bear moral responsibility for the predictable consequences.\n\nThe fundamental question isn't whether perfect moderation exists—it's whether companies that have created systems capable of spreading dangerous falsehoods at unprecedented scale have any responsibility for the harm those systems cause.\n\nMy opponents offer only the failed status quo: let misinformation run rampant and hope market forces somehow fix problems that market incentives created. We offer accountability, responsibility, and recognition that with great power comes great duty.\n\nVote affirmative because moral duty isn't optional when lives hang in the balance."
