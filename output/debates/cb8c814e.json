      "text": "Honorable judges, today I stand before you to argue that AI development should indeed be paused until safety is better understood. This resolution addresses one of the most critical decisions of our time—whether humanity should proceed cautiously or risk irreversible consequences in our pursuit of artificial intelligence.\n\nLet me establish the framework for evaluation. When I say \"AI development should be paused,\" I mean a temporary moratorium on advancing toward artificial general intelligence and more powerful AI systems until we have robust safety measures, governance frameworks, and comprehensive understanding of risks. This doesn't mean halting all AI research—safety research itself must accelerate.\n\nThe criterion for judgment is simple: which approach best serves humanity's long-term survival and flourishing?\n\nMy first argument centers on existential risk. Leading AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton and Stuart Russell, warn that advanced AI poses unprecedented dangers. Unlike previous technologies, AI systems could rapidly exceed human intelligence and control. Once we create superintelligent AI without proper safeguards, we cannot simply \"turn it off\" or fix our mistakes. This is a one-shot game where failure means extinction.\n\nSecond, our current safety measures are woefully inadequate. We cannot reliably control or predict the behavior of existing large language models, yet we're racing toward even more powerful systems. We lack fundamental solutions to the alignment problem—ensuring AI systems pursue human-beneficial goals rather than optimizing for unintended objectives that could be catastrophic.\n\nThird, the precautionary principle demands pause when facing potentially irreversible harm. We don't build nuclear reactors without understanding radiation safety, and we shouldn't build superintelligence without understanding AI safety. The potential benefits of AI will remain available after we develop proper safeguards, but the risks of proceeding recklessly are permanent.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. A brief pause now could prevent humanity's final mistake. We have one chance to get this right—let's take it."

      "text": "Judges, my opponent's case crumbles under scrutiny because it rests on unfounded fear-mongering and ignores the devastating consequences of their proposed pause.\n\nFirst, let's examine their existential risk argument. It is obvious that the researchers they cite represent a vocal minority whose predictions lack empirical foundation. Unless they can show otherwise, we must recognize that AI development has consistently proven safer than doomsday predictions suggested. The alignment problem they reference is clearly being solved incrementally through techniques like constitutional AI and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Their claim that we \"cannot reliably control\" current AI systems is demonstrably false—these systems operate within clear parameters and safety constraints.\n\nSecond, my opponent fundamentally misunderstands how technological progress works. Unless they can prove that innovation stops during their proposed pause, we must acknowledge that authoritarian regimes and bad actors will continue developing AI while democracies handicap themselves. It is obvious that a unilateral pause by responsible actors only ensures that dangerous AI will be developed by those with malicious intent. China and other nations will not pause—they will surge ahead while we voluntarily fall behind.\n\nThird, the precautionary principle cuts both ways. My opponent ignores that pausing AI development guarantees continued suffering from problems AI could solve. Unless they can demonstrate otherwise, millions will die from diseases that AI-accelerated drug discovery could cure. Climate change, poverty, and countless other challenges demand AI solutions that their pause would delay indefinitely.\n\nMost critically, their nuclear reactor analogy fails completely. It is obvious that AI development is not a binary switch but an evolutionary process where safety improves through iteration and real-world testing. We learn by building, not by theorizing in isolation.\n\nUnless my opponent can prove that theoretical future risks outweigh concrete present benefits, we must reject their dangerous proposal to surrender our technological leadership while real problems demand AI solutions today."

      "text": "Judges, my opponent's response reveals the dangerous thinking that got us into this predicament—dismissing legitimate safety concerns while making reckless assumptions about our ability to control advanced AI systems.\n\nLet me address their core errors systematically.\n\nFirst, they claim AI researchers warning about existential risk represent a \"vocal minority.\" This is factually incorrect. The 2023 Statement on AI Risk was signed by leading figures including Turing Award winners, heads of major AI labs like OpenAI and DeepMind, and hundreds of researchers. When the very people building these systems warn of catastrophic risks, dismissing them as \"fear-mongering\" demonstrates dangerous overconfidence.\n\nTheir claim that alignment is being \"solved incrementally\" misunderstands the problem entirely. Constitutional AI and RLHF are band-aids on systems we fundamentally don't understand. These techniques work for current narrow AI but break down as systems become more capable. We're essentially putting guardrails on a car while building a rocket ship.\n\nSecond, their \"authoritarian advantage\" argument actually supports my case. If we're concerned about China developing unsafe AI, the solution isn't a reckless race to the bottom—it's international coordination and treaties, exactly what a pause period would facilitate. Nuclear weapons didn't require every nation to race toward mutual destruction; we developed nonproliferation frameworks. The same approach applies here.\n\nThird, they invoke present suffering to justify future extinction risk. This is backwards reasoning. Yes, AI could help solve diseases and climate change—but these benefits remain available after we develop safety measures. Dead humans cannot be brought back to life if we create misaligned superintelligence.\n\nMost importantly, they ignore the fundamental asymmetry: if we pause and I'm wrong, we delay some benefits. If we don't pause and I'm right, humanity ends. When facing potential extinction, the burden of proof lies on those advocating for speed over safety.\n\nThe precautionary principle demands we pause. Our civilization's survival depends on it."

      "text": "Judges, this debate fundamentally comes down to one question: should we gamble humanity's future on unproven assumptions, or should we demand concrete evidence before proceeding with potentially civilization-ending technology?\n\nLet me crystallize why the negative position prevails on every major clash.\n\nFirst, on existential risk, my opponent retreats to appeal to authority rather than addressing substance. It is obvious that signing a statement doesn't constitute scientific proof of danger. Unless they can demonstrate actual mechanisms by which current AI systems pose existential threats, we must reject their speculative fears. The fact remains that AI development has proceeded safely for decades, and their doomsday scenarios remain purely theoretical.\n\nSecond, on the international competition clash, my opponent's treaty comparison fails completely. Nuclear weapons required massive infrastructure and rare materials—AI requires code and computing power. Unless they can show how international coordination would actually work when authoritarian regimes have every incentive to defect, their pause simply guarantees American technological surrender. It is obvious that China will not pause while we voluntarily handicap ourselves.\n\nThird, and most decisively, on the precautionary principle, my opponent commits a fatal logical error. They claim we can simply resume development after a pause, but this ignores that technological leadership, once lost, cannot be easily regained. Unless they can prove that pausing preserves rather than destroys our competitive advantage, we must recognize that their proposal guarantees the very outcome they fear—dangerous AI developed by irresponsible actors.\n\nThe asymmetry argument works against them. If we continue development responsibly, we maintain oversight and control. If we pause, we guarantee that AI development continues elsewhere without safety considerations.\n\nMost importantly, my opponent cannot answer the fundamental question: how does surrendering leadership to bad actors improve global AI safety? It is obvious that responsible development by democratic institutions serves safety better than abandoning the field to authoritarian regimes.\n\nVote negative—because leadership, not surrender, ensures AI safety."
