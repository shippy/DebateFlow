      "text": "# Opening Constructive Speech — Affirmative\n\nThank you. I rise in firm support of the resolution: **This house believes that social media companies have a moral duty to censor misinformation.**\n\n## Definitions and Framework\n\nLet me begin by establishing clear terms. **Misinformation** refers to demonstrably false claims — not matters of opinion or political disagreement, but factual falsehoods that can be verified against scientific consensus, established evidence, or documented reality. **Moral duty** means an ethical obligation arising from one's position, power, and relationship to others — distinct from a legal mandate. And **censor** here means to remove, label, or reduce the amplification of such content.\n\nI propose we evaluate this debate through a **harm-prevention framework**: entities that profit from creating and controlling an environment bear moral responsibility for the foreseeable harms that environment produces.\n\n## Argument 1: Power Creates Responsibility\n\nSocial media companies are not passive bulletin boards. They design algorithms that actively amplify content based on engagement. Research consistently demonstrates that false, sensational content generates more engagement and is therefore preferentially distributed. These companies have *created* the conditions under which misinformation thrives. When you build the megaphone, point it at billions of people, and profit from what it broadcasts, you bear moral responsibility for what it amplifies.\n\n## Argument 2: Demonstrable, Severe Harm\n\nUnchecked misinformation on social media has contributed to measurable, catastrophic harm. COVID-19 vaccine misinformation contributed to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths. Election misinformation has undermined democratic institutions worldwide. Health misinformation about cancer treatments has led people to abandon effective care. The causal chain from platform amplification to real-world harm is well-documented. No moral framework — utilitarian, deontological, or virtue-based — permits an entity to knowingly facilitate mass harm while possessing the capacity to mitigate it.\n\n## Argument 3: The Social Contract of Platform Power\n\nThese companies occupy a unique position in the information ecosystem, functioning as de facto public squares while remaining private entities with full editorial capability. They already moderate content — removing pornography, terrorism recruitment, and spam. The infrastructure and precedent exist. Choosing to filter some harmful content while refusing to address misinformation is itself a moral choice — and an indefensible one.\n\nThe moral duty is clear. I look forward to my opponent's response."

      "text": "# Opening Constructive Speech — Negative\n\nThank you. I rise in firm opposition to this resolution, and I want to engage directly with the arguments we've just heard.\n\n## The Definition Problem Defeats the Resolution\n\nMy opponent begins by defining misinformation as \"demonstrably false claims\" verified against \"scientific consensus.\" This sounds clean in theory but collapses in practice. Scientific consensus *shifts* — the lab leak hypothesis was labeled misinformation in 2020 and is now considered plausible by major intelligence agencies. Dietary fat guidelines, the efficacy of masking, the transmissibility timeline of COVID — all involved claims initially censored that later proved credible. When we grant corporations the moral authority to determine truth, we don't eliminate misinformation — we merely centralize the power to *define* it. And centralized truth-determination by profit-driven entities is far more dangerous than a messy open discourse.\n\n## Refuting the Power-Responsibility Argument\n\nMy opponent argues that designing algorithms creates moral responsibility to censor. But this conflates two distinct obligations. Companies may have a duty to *redesign amplification systems* — but that is fundamentally different from a duty to *censor content*. You can reduce algorithmic amplification without deciding what is true and what is false. The moral answer to a poorly designed megaphone is to fix the megaphone, not to appoint its manufacturer as the arbiter of acceptable speech.\n\n## The Harm Argument Proves Too Much\n\nYes, misinformation causes harm. But so does *censorship* of information that turns out to be correct. Every wrongly suppressed truth delays public understanding and erodes institutional trust. My opponent's framework — that entities must prevent foreseeable harm — applies equally to the foreseeable harms of censorship: chilled speech, suppressed dissent, and the consolidation of narrative control among unaccountable corporations. The cure cannot be worse than the disease.\n\n## The Social Contract Argument Backfires\n\nMy opponent notes these platforms function as \"de facto public squares.\" Precisely. Public squares are where speech is *most* protected, not least. The comparison to removing terrorism content fails — terrorism recruitment involves *coordination of illegal activity*, a categorically different matter from factual disputes. Extending that precedent to contested empirical claims is a breathtaking expansion of corporate editorial power that should alarm anyone who values open inquiry.\n\n## The Real Moral Duty\n\nThe genuine moral duty is to **empower users** — through media literacy, transparent algorithms, and access to counter-speech — not to install corporate gatekeepers over public discourse. Truth emerges from contestation, not from suppression.\n\nThe resolution must fall."

      "text": "# Rebuttal Speech — Affirmative\n\nThank you. My opponent has delivered a compelling and well-structured case, and I want to engage with it honestly and directly.\n\n## Acknowledging the Strongest Challenge\n\nLet me begin by conceding what I think is my opponent's most powerful point: the definition problem is real and serious. The lab leak example is not a trivial edge case — it represents a genuine instance where premature censorship suppressed legitimate inquiry. I must acknowledge that any system of content moderation will inevitably produce false positives, and those false positives carry real costs. Scientific understanding does evolve, and my initial framing of \"demonstrably false claims verified against scientific consensus\" was perhaps too confident about the stability of consensus itself.\n\n## Rethinking the Mechanism\n\nMy opponent draws a crucial distinction that I find increasingly persuasive — the difference between censoring content and redesigning amplification systems. I initially argued these were part of the same moral obligation, but I think my opponent is right that they are fundamentally different interventions. Removing content requires a truth judgment; adjusting algorithmic amplification requires only recognizing that engagement-optimized distribution creates perverse incentives. The latter addresses the structural problem I identified — that platforms *create* the conditions for misinformation to thrive — without requiring corporations to become arbiters of truth. This is actually a more precise solution to the problem I diagnosed.\n\n## The Public Square Concern\n\nMy opponent correctly notes that I characterized these platforms as de facto public squares, and I stand by that characterization. But I'm compelled to recognize that this framing does indeed cut in a complicated direction. If these spaces function as public squares, then the norms governing them should perhaps prioritize openness and contestation rather than corporate editorial control. The terrorism comparison I drew was, I now recognize, categorically distinct from factual disputes in ways that matter.\n\n## Where This Leaves Us\n\nThe moral duty I identified — that platforms must address the harms their systems create — remains valid. But my opponent has persuaded me that the *mechanism* matters enormously. Empowering users through transparency, media literacy, and algorithmic reform addresses the root cause rather than the symptoms. Content removal places extraordinary epistemic authority in corporate hands, and the track record of that authority is genuinely troubling. The moral obligation is better fulfilled through structural reform and user empowerment than through censorship per se.\n\nThe duty to act remains — but the right action is more nuanced than the resolution suggests."

      "text": "# Closing Speech — Negative\n\nThank you. Let me explain why this debate has been decisively won by the Negative.\n\n## What Just Happened\n\nSomething remarkable occurred in this exchange: my opponent, in their rebuttal, conceded the three central pillars of my case. I want to be clear about what was conceded and why each concession is fatal to the resolution.\n\n## Clash 1: The Definition Problem\n\nMy opponent acknowledged that the definition problem is \"real and serious\" and that their framing was \"perhaps too confident about the stability of consensus itself.\" This is not a peripheral concession — it is devastating. The resolution asks us to affirm a **moral duty to censor misinformation**. If we cannot reliably distinguish misinformation from contested-but-legitimate claims, then a moral duty to censor becomes a moral duty to exercise a power we cannot wield responsibly. You cannot have a moral obligation to do something that will systematically and foreseeably suppress truths alongside falsehoods. The lab leak example isn't an anomaly — it's the inevitable consequence of granting fallible institutions the authority to police factual claims in real time. A moral duty that predictably produces serious harm is no moral duty at all.\n\n## Clash 2: Censorship vs. Structural Reform\n\nMy opponent conceded that my distinction between censoring content and redesigning amplification systems was \"increasingly persuasive\" and \"a more precise solution.\" This concession directly undermines the resolution. The resolution specifically states that social media companies have a moral duty to **censor** misinformation — not to reform algorithms, not to improve transparency, not to promote media literacy. My opponent has effectively agreed that the mechanism the resolution prescribes is the wrong one. You cannot vote Affirmative on a resolution whose core prescription has been abandoned by its own advocate.\n\n## Clash 3: The Public Square\n\nMy opponent acknowledged that their public square framing \"cuts in a complicated direction\" and that the terrorism analogy was \"categorically distinct\" from factual disputes. This eliminates the precedent argument entirely. The existing moderation of illegal coordination provides no justification for extending corporate editorial power over empirical claims.\n\n## Weighing the Debate\n\nThe Affirmative identified a real problem — platforms amplify harmful content. I never disputed this. But the resolution doesn't ask whether a problem exists. It asks whether **censorship** is the morally required response. On this specific question, even my opponent ultimately agreed it is not.\n\nThe alternative I proposed — empowering users through transparency, algorithmic reform, and counter-speech — addresses the same harms without concentrating epistemic authority in unaccountable corporate hands, without chilling legitimate inquiry, and without creating a system that inevitably suppresses truths it cannot yet recognize.\n\nWhen both sides of a debate agree that censorship is the wrong mechanism, the resolution must fall. I urge a Negative ballot."
