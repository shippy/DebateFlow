      "text": "Honorable judges, today I stand before you to argue that this house should indeed make voting compulsory.\n\nLet me first establish the framework for this debate. Compulsory voting means legally requiring all eligible citizens to cast a ballot in elections, with reasonable penalties for non-compliance, such as small fines. This system operates successfully in over 20 countries, including Australia and Belgium.\n\nWe should evaluate this resolution based on three key criteria: democratic legitimacy, political equality, and governance outcomes.\n\nMy first argument centers on democratic legitimacy. Democracy derives its authority from the consent of the governed, yet in voluntary systems, governments often win with support from merely 20-30% of the total electorate. Compulsory voting ensures elected officials have genuine mandates from the entire citizenry, not just the most politically engaged minorities. When turnout approaches 95%, as seen in Australia, governments can claim true democratic legitimacy.\n\nSecond, compulsory voting promotes political equality by eliminating participation gaps between different socioeconomic groups. Currently, wealthy, educated, and older citizens vote at much higher rates than the poor, young, and marginalized. This creates a vicious cycle where politicians cater primarily to reliable voters, ignoring the needs of non-participants. Mandatory voting breaks this cycle, forcing politicians to appeal to all citizens equally.\n\nThird, compulsory voting produces superior governance outcomes. Politicians must moderate extreme positions to appeal to the median voter rather than energizing narrow bases. This reduces polarization and promotes centrist, pragmatic policies. Additionally, higher turnout correlates with increased government investment in public goods like education and healthcare, benefiting society broadly.\n\nCritics may argue this violates individual freedom, but we already mandate jury duty and tax filing as civic obligations. The minimal burden of casting a ballot—with options for blank votes to preserve conscience—is a reasonable price for democratic participation.\n\nFurthermore, compulsory voting actually enhances freedom by ensuring all voices count equally in shaping the policies that govern our lives.\n\nThe evidence is clear: compulsory voting strengthens democracy, promotes equality, and improves governance. I urge you to affirm this resolution."

      "text": "Honorable judges, my opponent paints a rosy picture of compulsory voting, but their arguments crumble under scrutiny.\n\nFirst, let's examine their claim about democratic legitimacy. My opponent argues that low turnout undermines government mandates, but this commits a fundamental error in reasoning. The percentage of eligible voters who participate tells us nothing about the quality or validity of democratic choice. In fact, voluntary abstention is itself a form of political expression—a conscious decision that \"none of the above\" represents one's preferences. When we force disengaged citizens to vote randomly or based on superficial factors like name recognition, we actually dilute the voices of informed, passionate citizens who chose to participate voluntarily.\n\nConsider this: would you rather have a surgeon chosen by ten medical experts, or one selected by those same ten experts plus ninety random people pulled off the street? The analogy is clear—forcing participation doesn't enhance legitimacy; it corrupts the democratic process.\n\nMy opponent's second argument about political equality is equally flawed. They assume that compulsory voting will somehow make politicians responsive to all citizens equally, but this creates a false choice between our current system and perfect representation. In reality, politicians will simply shift their focus from mobilizing supporters to manipulating the newly-forced voters through populist appeals and superficial messaging. The wealthy and educated will still have advantages in accessing information and understanding complex issues—compulsory voting doesn't eliminate these disparities.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent's governance argument fails catastrophically. They claim mandatory voting produces moderation, but Australia—their prime example—has seen increasing political polarization despite compulsory voting. The evidence simply doesn't support their conclusion.\n\nMost fundamentally, compulsory voting violates the basic principle of individual autonomy. Unlike jury duty, which serves a specific judicial function, voting is an expression of political will. Forcing someone to express political preferences they don't hold is tantamount to compelled speech—a clear violation of democratic principles.\n\nThe choice is simple: preserve democratic freedom or embrace authoritarian control over political expression."

      "text": "Honorable judges, my opponent's response reveals fundamental misunderstandings about both democracy and compulsory voting systems.\n\nLet me first address their surgeon analogy, which perfectly illustrates their elitist perspective. Democracy isn't about finding the \"best\" candidate through expert opinion—it's about collective self-governance where every citizen's voice matters equally. My opponent essentially argues that some citizens are more qualified to participate than others, a dangerous proposition that undermines democratic equality. The whole point of democracy is that ordinary citizens, not political elites, should determine their government.\n\nMy opponent claims voluntary abstention is \"political expression,\" but this ignores reality. Most non-voters aren't making conscious political statements—they're excluded by structural barriers like work schedules, transportation issues, or registration difficulties. Australia's experience proves this: when voting became compulsory, participation didn't become \"random\"—it became universal, giving voice to previously marginalized communities.\n\nRegarding political equality, my opponent offers no alternative solution to the documented problem of turnout gaps. They dismiss the benefits while ignoring that compulsory voting has measurably reduced class-based participation disparities in every country that's implemented it. Yes, information gaps persist, but at least all citizens have equal opportunity to influence outcomes rather than being systematically excluded.\n\nOn governance outcomes, my opponent cherry-picks Australia's recent polarization while ignoring decades of stable, moderate governance that coincided with compulsory voting. They also ignore comparative evidence showing that countries with mandatory voting have lower inequality and higher social spending—clear indicators of governments responding to broader constituencies.\n\nFinally, their \"compelled speech\" argument fails because compulsory voting doesn't force anyone to support particular candidates. Citizens can vote blank, write in candidates, or spoil ballots—the requirement is participation, not endorsement.\n\nMy opponent's case ultimately rests on preserving a system that systematically excludes millions of citizens from democratic participation. True democratic freedom means ensuring everyone has an equal voice in shaping the policies that govern their lives. Compulsory voting delivers that promise."

      "text": "Honorable judges, this debate ultimately comes down to a fundamental question: should democracy serve all citizens equally, or should we preserve a system that systematically excludes entire communities from political participation?\n\nLet me crystallize the key clashes and demonstrate why the negative position prevails.\n\nFirst, on democratic legitimacy, my opponent continues to conflate quantity with quality. They argue that forcing 95% participation somehow creates stronger mandates than voluntary systems, but this reasoning is deeply flawed. If a restaurant forced every passerby to choose between two meals they didn't want, would the \"winner\" truly represent popular preference? The parallel is exact—compulsory voting creates artificial mandates based on coerced rather than genuine political expression.\n\nMoreover, my opponent's response actually proves our point about diluting informed voices. When they dismiss the surgeon analogy as \"elitist,\" they reveal their willingness to sacrifice decision-making quality for mere numerical participation. Democracy requires informed consent, not just consent by force.\n\nSecond, regarding political equality, my opponent commits a classic hasty generalization. Because some non-voters face structural barriers, they assume all abstention results from exclusion rather than choice. This ignores the millions of citizens who deliberately choose not to participate because they find no meaningful differences between candidates or reject the entire political system. These individuals have every right to express their dissent through non-participation.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent provides no evidence that compulsory voting actually eliminates the influence disparities they claim to address. Wealthy interests will simply adapt their strategies to manipulate newly-forced voters through emotional appeals and misinformation campaigns.\n\nOn governance outcomes, the evidence decisively favors our position. My opponent cannot explain why compulsory voting hasn't prevented rising polarization in Australia, nor why voluntary democracies like Switzerland consistently rank among the world's most stable and prosperous nations.\n\nMost critically, compulsory voting fundamentally violates individual autonomy. Political participation must remain voluntary to maintain its legitimacy. The moment we force citizens to engage in political expression, we cross the line from democracy into authoritarianism.\n\nThe choice before you is clear: preserve democratic freedom or embrace coercive participation that undermines the very principles democracy represents."
