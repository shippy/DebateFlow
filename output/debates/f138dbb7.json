      "text": "# Affirmative Constructive Speech\n\nThank you. I stand firmly in favor of the resolution that the benefits of globalization have outweighed its costs for developing nations.\n\n## Framework and Definitions\n\nGlobalization refers to the increasing integration of economies, societies, and cultures through cross-border trade, investment, technology transfer, and the movement of people and ideas. Developing nations are those countries with lower per capita income and less industrialized economies. Critically, we must evaluate this resolution on **net balance** — not whether globalization is perfect, but whether the aggregate benefits have exceeded the aggregate costs.\n\n## Contention 1: Unprecedented Poverty Reduction\n\nThe most powerful evidence is the dramatic decline in global extreme poverty. In 1990, 36% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty. By 2019, that figure fell to approximately 8.4%. This reduction — lifting over one billion people from destitution — occurred precisely during the era of accelerated globalization. Countries like China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh integrated into global markets and experienced historic economic growth. The World Bank consistently identifies trade openness and foreign investment as central drivers of this transformation.\n\n## Contention 2: Technology Transfer and Human Development\n\nGlobalization has delivered life-saving technologies to the developing world. Mobile phone penetration in Sub-Saharan Africa went from nearly zero to over 80% in two decades, revolutionizing banking, agriculture, and communication. Medical advances, vaccines, and pharmaceutical knowledge have flowed across borders, contributing to a rise in average life expectancy in developing nations from 55 years in 1990 to 65 years today. Literacy rates have surged. Infant mortality has plummeted. These are not coincidences — they are consequences of global interconnection.\n\n## Contention 3: Economic Diversification and Empowerment\n\nAccess to global markets has allowed developing nations to diversify beyond subsistence agriculture and raw commodity exports. Countries like South Korea, once among the poorest nations on earth, leveraged globalization to become economic powerhouses. Export-oriented growth has created millions of manufacturing and service-sector jobs, disproportionately benefiting women entering the formal workforce for the first time.\n\n## Contention 4: The Counterfactual\n\nWe must ask: what was the alternative? Autarky and isolation have consistently produced worse outcomes — consider North Korea versus South Korea, or pre-reform China versus post-reform China.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming. Globalization, while imperfect, has delivered transformative benefits that decisively outweigh its costs."

      "text": "# Negative Constructive Speech\n\nThank you. My opponent has painted a rosy picture, but it fundamentally collapses under scrutiny. Let me address their arguments directly before presenting the negative case.\n\n## Refuting the Poverty Reduction Myth\n\nMy opponent's poverty statistics are essentially a China story. Remove China from the dataset, and global poverty reduction becomes far less impressive. It is obvious that China's poverty reduction was driven primarily by internal state-directed industrial policy, land reform, and massive public investment — not by passive integration into global markets. Unless my opponent can show that globalization *itself*, rather than domestic policy choices, was the decisive causal factor, their entire first contention fails. Correlation during the era of globalization is not causation.\n\n## The Technology Transfer Illusion\n\nMobile phones in Sub-Saharan Africa sound impressive until you examine who controls the technology, who extracts the profits, and who owns the intellectual property. It is obvious that technology transfer under globalization has been overwhelmingly one-directional — developing nations remain consumers and assemblers, not innovators. The TRIPS agreement and patent regimes imposed through globalization have actually *restricted* developing nations' access to essential medicines and technologies. Unless my opponent can demonstrate that developing nations have gained genuine technological sovereignty rather than deepened dependency, this contention rings hollow.\n\n## The Costs My Opponent Ignores\n\nMy opponent conveniently omits devastating costs. Structural adjustment programs imposed by the IMF and World Bank — the very architects of globalization — gutted public health systems, education, and social safety nets across Africa and Latin America throughout the 1990s. Deindustrialization has plagued nations that opened their markets prematurely, as local industries were destroyed by subsidized foreign competition. Environmental degradation has been catastrophic — developing nations have become dumping grounds for polluting industries and toxic waste.\n\n## The Inequality Explosion\n\nGlobalization has produced staggering inequality both between and within developing nations. The few success stories — South Korea, China — are exceptions, not the rule. Unless my opponent can explain why dozens of African and Latin American nations that embraced globalization remain trapped in poverty and debt, their case is built on survivorship bias.\n\n## The Counterfactual Fallacy\n\nComparing North Korea to South Korea is a Cold War argument, not a globalization argument. The real counterfactual isn't autarky versus globalization — it's *this* form of globalization versus fairer alternatives that developing nations were never permitted to pursue.\n\nThe costs have been profound, structural, and ongoing. The resolution must fall."

      "text": "# Affirmative Rebuttal Speech\n\nThank you. My opponent's case relies on selective framing, impossible standards of proof, and a fundamental mischaracterization of the evidence. Let me respond systematically.\n\n## The \"China Story\" Deflection\n\nMy opponent asks us to remove China — a developing nation with 1.4 billion people — from the dataset to make their argument work. That's not analysis; that's cherry-picking in reverse. China *is* a developing nation. Its integration into global markets through WTO accession, foreign direct investment, and export-led manufacturing is *precisely* a globalization success story. Yes, domestic policy mattered — no one denies that. But those policies *leveraged* globalization. Deng Xiaoping's reforms worked because there were global markets to access. Moreover, the poverty reduction story extends well beyond China: Vietnam cut poverty from 58% to under 5% through trade integration. Bangladesh's garment industry lifted millions from subsistence. India's IT sector created a new middle class. My opponent cannot dismiss an entire continent of evidence.\n\n## Technology Transfer and Dependency\n\nMy opponent argues developing nations are \"consumers, not innovators.\" But this presents a false binary. India is now the world's largest IT services exporter. Kenya's M-Pesa mobile banking system — born in a developing nation — revolutionized global fintech. Regarding TRIPS, my opponent ignores the Doha Declaration, which explicitly carved out public health flexibilities, enabling nations like India to produce generic medications that serve the entire developing world. Imperfect access is vastly superior to no access at all.\n\n## Structural Adjustment: A Concession\n\nMy opponent's strongest point — structural adjustment programs — actually *supports* my case. These programs represented a *specific policy failure* within the broader globalization framework, and they were largely abandoned precisely because they didn't work. The fact that the global community recognized and corrected these failures demonstrates that globalization is a reformable, evolving system — not an inherently destructive one.\n\n## Survivorship Bias or Survivorship Evidence?\n\nMy opponent calls success stories \"exceptions.\" But South Korea, China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Botswana, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mauritius collectively represent *billions* of people. When your \"exceptions\" encompass the majority of the developing world's population, they aren't exceptions — they're the pattern.\n\n## The Alternative That Never Existed\n\nMy opponent invokes \"fairer alternatives\" that developing nations were \"never permitted to pursue.\" This is speculative and unfalsifiable. We must judge globalization against realistic alternatives, not utopian hypotheticals. The historical record of autarky — import substitution in Latin America, isolationism in Myanmar and North Korea — consistently produced stagnation.\n\nThe resolution stands. Globalization's benefits have decisively outweighed its costs for developing nations."

      "role": "closing",
      "text": "# Negative Closing Speech\n\nThank you. Let me crystallize the key clashes in this debate and explain why the negative position has prevailed on each.\n\n## Clash 1: Poverty Reduction and Causation\n\nMy opponent never adequately addressed the causation problem. They simply reasserted that because poverty declined during globalization, globalization caused it. But it is obvious that the nations my opponent celebrates most — China, Vietnam, South Korea — succeeded precisely because they *violated* free-market globalization orthodoxy. They used capital controls, state-owned enterprises, industrial subsidies, and selective protectionism. These nations engaged with global markets on *their own terms*, not on the terms globalization's architects prescribed. Unless my opponent can show that the IMF-World Bank model of liberalization — the actual policy package called \"globalization\" — produced these results rather than strategic state intervention, their poverty argument remains fundamentally unproven. The nations that followed the globalization playbook faithfully — much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America in the 1990s — experienced debt crises, deindustrialization, and stagnation.\n\n## Clash 2: The Structural Costs Were Never Answered\n\nMy opponent remarkably conceded that structural adjustment programs were devastating, then tried to spin this as evidence that globalization is \"reformable.\" This is extraordinary. Decades of gutted healthcare systems, destroyed local industries, and imposed austerity across dozens of nations — affecting hundreds of millions of people — cannot be waved away as a corrected mistake. Those costs were *real*, they were *structural*, and for many nations, they are *ongoing*. The debt burdens imposed during that era still constrain public investment today. My opponent wants credit for the benefits while disclaiming responsibility for the costs. You cannot have it both ways.\n\n## Clash 3: Inequality and the Majority of Nations\n\nMy opponent listed roughly twelve success stories and claimed they represent \"the pattern.\" But there are approximately 150 developing nations. It is obvious that when the vast majority of developing countries have not replicated East Asian success — when income gaps between the richest and poorest nations have widened, when Africa's share of global trade has actually *declined* during the globalization era — we cannot declare the benefits have outweighed the costs for developing nations as a class. My opponent's argument is built on survivorship bias, and they never refuted this charge — they simply relabeled it.\n\n## Clash 4: The Counterfactual\n\nMy opponent insists the only alternative to this globalization was autarky. This is a false dichotomy. The real question is whether developing nations could have integrated globally under fairer terms — with policy space to protect infant industries, without coercive intellectual property regimes, without forced capital account liberalization. Historical evidence from the very success stories my opponent cites proves this alternative was viable. The nations that succeeded *rejected* the standard globalization package.\n\n## Weighing the Debate\n\nThe affirmative's case ultimately reduces to: some nations that strategically managed their integration prospered. The negative's case is: the actual system of globalization — its rules, institutions, and power dynamics — imposed devastating costs on the majority of developing nations while concentrating benefits among a select few. When we weigh structural inequality, deindustrialization, environmental devastation, debt dependency, and the hollowing of public institutions against the genuine but geographically concentrated gains, the costs have not been outweighed.\n\nVote negative."
