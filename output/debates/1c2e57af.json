      "text": "Thank you, judge.\n\nToday's resolution asks us to evaluate whether social media has been a net negative for democracy. I'll define democracy as a system of government where citizens participate in decision-making through voting, civic engagement, and informed public discourse. \"Net negative\" means the harmful effects outweigh any benefits.\n\nI'll argue that social media has fundamentally undermined three pillars essential to democratic society: informed deliberation, social cohesion, and electoral integrity.\n\n**First, social media destroys informed public discourse.** Democracy requires citizens to engage with complex issues through reasoned debate. Instead, social media algorithms prioritize engagement over accuracy, amplifying sensational and divisive content. Studies show false news spreads six times faster than truth on platforms like Twitter. Echo chambers and filter bubbles prevent exposure to diverse viewpoints, creating a fragmented information landscape where citizens can't agree on basic facts. When we can't establish shared truth, democratic deliberation becomes impossible.\n\n**Second, social media fractures social cohesion necessary for democratic governance.** Democracy depends on viewing political opponents as legitimate participants in the same system. Social media's design encourages tribal thinking and dehumanization of the \"other side.\" Research demonstrates that social media use correlates with increased political polarization and decreased trust in democratic institutions. When citizens view fellow Americans as existential threats rather than fellow democrats, compromise and peaceful transitions of power become impossible.\n\n**Third, social media enables unprecedented threats to electoral integrity.** Foreign actors exploit these platforms to interfere in elections, as documented in 2016 and beyond. Domestic bad actors spread disinformation about voting processes, undermining faith in election results. The January 6th Capitol attack was largely organized on social media platforms, representing a direct assault on democratic governance.\n\nWhile social media may facilitate some political participation, these benefits pale compared to its systematic erosion of truth, trust, and democratic norms. The evidence is clear: social media's impact on democracy has been overwhelmingly destructive.\n\nI urge you to affirm this resolution."

      "text": "Thank you, judge.\n\nMy opponent's case crumbles under scrutiny because they fundamentally misunderstand both social media's democratizing power and the nature of democratic progress itself.\n\n**First, on informed discourse:** It is obvious that social media has created the most informed citizenry in human history. Unless my opponent can show otherwise, we must recognize that platforms like Twitter and Facebook give ordinary citizens direct access to primary sources, breaking the monopoly of traditional media gatekeepers who filtered information for decades. The claim about \"false news spreading faster\" ignores the self-correcting mechanisms inherent in these platforms - community notes, fact-checking, and crowd-sourced verification that didn't exist before social media.\n\n**Second, regarding polarization:** My opponent conflates correlation with causation without any compelling evidence. Political polarization has deep historical roots that predate social media by decades. Unless they can demonstrate that social media *caused* rather than merely *revealed* existing divisions, their argument fails. Moreover, it is self-evident that connecting like-minded citizens strengthens democratic participation - the civil rights movement, women's suffrage, and labor organizing all relied on bringing together people with shared values.\n\n**Third, on electoral integrity:** The January 6th example actually proves social media's democratic value. These platforms allowed real-time documentation of events, enabled rapid fact-checking, and facilitated accountability measures. Foreign interference existed long before social media - unless my opponent can show that social media made such interference uniquely dangerous compared to traditional methods like radio broadcasts or print propaganda, this point is irrelevant.\n\nMy opponent's entire framework assumes that democracy requires artificial consensus and controlled information flow. This is fundamentally anti-democratic. True democracy thrives on robust debate, direct citizen engagement, and transparent information sharing - precisely what social media provides.\n\nThe resolution fails because social media has empowered democratic participation in unprecedented ways."

      "text": "Thank you, judge.\n\nMy opponent's response reveals the fundamental weakness of their position through three critical errors.\n\n**First, their \"most informed citizenry\" claim is demonstrably false.** They offer no evidence while ignoring extensive research showing social media users are actually *less* informed about basic political facts. The Reuters Institute found that people who get news primarily from social media score significantly lower on political knowledge tests than those using traditional sources. My opponent's \"self-correcting mechanisms\" argument fails because studies show corrections reach only a fraction of those who saw the original misinformation. Twitter's community notes, for example, appear on less than 1% of misleading tweets and often hours after viral spread.\n\n**Second, my opponent mischaracterizes the polarization evidence.** I'm not claiming social media created all political division—I'm demonstrating it *accelerated* and *amplified* existing tensions to democracy-threatening levels. Research by Boxell, Gentzkow, and Shapiro shows polarization increased most rapidly among demographics with highest social media usage. The speed and scale matter: while historical movements organized over months or years, social media enables instantaneous mobilization around false information, as we saw with QAnon's rapid spread.\n\n**Third, their January 6th response is particularly revealing.** They claim social media \"documented\" events while ignoring that these same platforms *organized* the attack. The \"Stop the Steal\" movement gained millions of followers through algorithmic amplification of election lies. My opponent cannot dismiss this as mere \"revelation\" of existing sentiment when the platforms actively promoted conspiracy theories to users who hadn't previously engaged with such content.\n\n**Most critically, my opponent's framework is backwards.** They argue democracy requires \"robust debate\" but ignore that social media systematically destroys the conditions for productive debate—shared facts, good faith engagement, and respect for democratic norms. When citizens inhabit completely different information universes and view opponents as illegitimate, \"robust debate\" becomes impossible.\n\nThe evidence remains overwhelming: social media's assault on truth, trust, and democratic institutions far outweighs any participatory benefits."

      "text": "Thank you, judge.\n\nThis debate ultimately comes down to whether we prioritize theoretical democratic ideals or confront democracy's actual deterioration under social media's influence.\n\n**On the information clash:** My opponent claims social media creates informed citizens, but this is obviously contradicted by reality. Unless they can explain why misinformation campaigns succeed so spectacularly on these platforms, we must accept that algorithmic amplification of false content is inherently anti-democratic. It is self-evident that democracy cannot function when citizens operate from fundamentally different factual premises - something that was impossible in the pre-social media era when shared information sources existed.\n\n**On polarization:** My opponent's causation argument misses the point entirely. Unless they can show that the *speed and intensity* of current polarization would have occurred without social media's algorithmic amplification, their historical comparisons fail. The civil rights movement they cite actually proves my point - it succeeded through building broad coalitions and changing minds through sustained argument, not through algorithmic echo chambers that prevent exposure to opposing views.\n\n**On electoral integrity:** My opponent's January 6th response reveals their fundamental confusion. They cannot simultaneously claim social media \"documented\" events while ignoring that it *enabled* the unprecedented assault on democratic institutions. Unless they can demonstrate that such rapid, large-scale mobilization around election lies could have occurred through traditional media, this point stands uncontested.\n\n**The framework question is decisive:** My opponent argues for \"robust debate\" but cannot address how such debate occurs when citizens inhabit completely separate information universes. It is obvious that meaningful democratic deliberation requires some shared foundation of facts - something social media has systematically destroyed.\n\nThe judge must weigh theoretical benefits against documented harms. While my opponent speaks of democratic empowerment, I've shown concrete evidence of democracy's actual degradation. Unless they can prove that increased participation matters more than the integrity of democratic institutions themselves, the resolution stands affirmed.\n\nSocial media's net impact on democracy has been catastrophically negative."
