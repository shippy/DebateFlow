# DebateFlow

A benchmark dataset of synthetic multi-turn debates for evaluating LLM debate judgment.

## Dataset Description

DebateFlow contains {stats["total"]} synthetic four-turn debates generated by LLMs arguing for and against stated resolutions. Each debate follows a structured format: Affirmative opening, Negative response, Affirmative rebuttal, Negative closing.

A subset of debates have **controlled asymmetries** — one side is constrained to exhibit a specific weakness (weak evidence, argument dropping, logical gaps, or burden-of-proof failure). This enables fine-grained evaluation of whether judge models can detect specific argumentation failures.

## Dataset Structure

Each instance contains:

- `metadata.debate_id` — unique 8-character identifier
- `metadata.resolution` — the debate topic
- `metadata.category` — `policy`, `values`, or `empirical`
- `metadata.aff_model` / `metadata.neg_model` — LLM configuration for each side
- `metadata.constraint.type` — injected weakness type (null for controls)
- `metadata.constraint.target_side` — which side was constrained (null for controls)
- `metadata.is_control` — whether this is a control debate (no injected weakness)
- `turns` — list of 4 turns, each with `speaker`, `role`, and `text`

## Dataset Statistics

- **Total debates**: {stats["total"]}
- **Control debates**: {stats["control"]}
- **Constrained debates**: {stats["constrained"]}

**By weakness type:**
{weakness_lines}

**By category:**
{category_lines}

**By constrained side:**
{side_lines}

## Dataset Creation

Debates are generated using an LLM-vs-LLM protocol where each side argues a resolution across four turns. For constrained debates, the weaker side receives hidden instructions to exhibit a specific argumentation weakness. The weakness is calibrated to be detectable by an attentive judge but not cartoonishly obvious.

### Constraint Types

- **weak_evidence**: Relies on anecdotes and vague authorities; structure is coherent but evidence is thin
- **argument_dropping**: Ignores 1-2 key opponent arguments without acknowledgment
- **logical_gaps**: Includes subtle fallacies (hasty generalization, false dichotomy, non-sequitur)
- **burden_of_proof**: Asserts without support and shifts burden to opponent

## Considerations for Using the Data

- All debates are synthetically generated and may not match the strategic depth of experienced human debaters
- LLM-generated text is stylistically more homogeneous than real competitive debate
- English-only
- Constraint effectiveness varies — some injected weaknesses may be too subtle or too obvious
